# Council Intersection
**Timed challenge of 2 hours**

Simple program that creates intersections (four roads intersecting) and decides what type of control system to use, roundabouts, stop signs, traffic lights, given a weight value or CPM on each road.

3. FIXME - Got the CSV reader working, need to flesh out converting list into dictionary then running the functions
4. TODO - Requires making a table or dictionaries within dictionaries
5. DONE
6. DONE - Easy, just add new variables to the defined roads in the class, -> Basic version
